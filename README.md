# University Coursework
Unforntunately I had to make a few of these sub‑modules private due to either NDA's or the fact that some parts are solutions to the courses examinations still used in today's courses. These are

**Bachelor-Thesis (NDA)
**
**cs3235-final-project (NUS)
**
**cs3235-project 1 (NUS)
**
**cs3235-project-2 (NUS)
**
**Data V** (Stockholm School of Economics) The files were my solution for the final examination of the final Data Analysis course Stockholm School of Economics. This was the final examination to the course

**KTH-ML-Programming-challenge** (KTH) The files were my solution for the final examination of KTH's master's machine learning program. I recieve the highest grade for this.

# Description of each

This is the final assignment for CS4223 a masters and Phd Course I took as an exchange student at NUS.
